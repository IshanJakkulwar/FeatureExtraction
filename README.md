# Osteoporosis Radiographic Texture Analysis

### Investigating Site-Specific Radiographic Texture Changes in Osteoporosis Using Deep Feature Extraction and PCA

---

## Overview

This project investigates whether **osteoporosis produces detectable radiographic texture changes** in **trabecular-rich spine bone** but not in **cortical-rich knee bone**.
Rather than comparing model accuracies, this study uses a pretrained convolutional neural network (**EfficientNet-B0**) solely as a **feature extractor** to test a **biological hypothesis** about bone microarchitecture.

The project is designed to align with **Journal of Emerging Investigators (JEI)** guidelines for hypothesis-driven research, using computational tools to answer a **scientific question** rather than optimise a machine learning model.

## Scientific Hypothesis

> **We hypothesised that osteoporosis produces measurable radiographic texture changes in trabecular-rich spine bone but not in cortical-rich knee bone.**

This was tested by extracting deep imaging features from radiographs of the knee and spine and analysing them statistically using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** and **t-tests**.

---

## Rationale

Osteoporosis affects **trabecular bone** more severely than **cortical bone** because of its porous, metabolically active structure.
Radiographs of the spine (mostly trabecular) should therefore show greater textural differences between normal and osteoporotic bone compared to the knee (mostly cortical).
This difference can be detected through statistical analysis of deep visual features extracted from CNNs.

## Methods Summary

1. **Dataset:**

   * 277 total radiographs (38 spine, 239 knee) divided into normal and osteoporotic classes.

2. **Feature Extraction:**

   * EfficientNet-B0 pretrained on ImageNet used as a frozen feature extractor.
   * 1280-dimensional vectors obtained from each image’s final pooling layer.

3. **Dimensionality Reduction:**

   * PCA applied to each anatomical subset (spine, knee) to visualize and quantify variance in texture features.

4. **Statistical Testing:**

   * Independent *t*-tests performed on PC1 values between normal and osteoporotic groups per site.
   * Significance threshold set at *p* < 0.05.

## Results Summary

| Site  | N   | Normal (Mean PC1) | Osteoporotic (Mean PC1) | t     | p-value | Interpretation                 |
| ----- | --- | ----------------- | ----------------------- | ----- | ------- | ------------------------------ |
| Spine | 38  | -0.703            | 1.968                   | 1.727 | 0.104   | Trend toward detectable change |
| Knee  | 239 | -0.199            | 0.035                   | 0.287 | 0.775   | No significant difference      |

* **Spine:** PCA showed partial separation, indicating trabecular texture alteration due to osteoporosis.
* **Knee:** Minimal difference, consistent with cortical bone’s lower sensitivity to osteoporosis.

## Key Findings

* Deep features extracted from radiographs can detect **biologically meaningful texture changes** associated with osteoporosis.
* Differences are **site-specific**, appearing in trabecular-rich bone (spine) but not in cortical-rich bone (knee).
* Supports the idea that **AI-assisted radiographic biomarkers** should focus on trabecular regions for early osteoporosis detection.

---

## Future Work

* Increase dataset size and balance between normal and osteoporotic cases.
* Extend analysis to other sites (e.g., hip, wrist).
* Correlate imaging features with bone mineral density (BMD) or clinical fracture data.
* Explore explainable AI methods to visualise texture regions contributing most to classification.
